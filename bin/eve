Beginning the switch-over to the eveOE/eveSeven program specs
eve.rb (not to be confused with the previous Eve.rb) will
serve as an entry-point into a runtime with our bot.

This file serves not only Ruby convention by offering a small
root file but it natively intoduces the ability to run the bot
in the background instead of maintaining a terminal/screen
connection with it's output feed.

require 'daemons' # This is a gem

require 'pathname' # AFAIK this is a native library to most rubies

# Grab the present working directory and concatenate

file = File.expand_path("../../lib/run/eveService.rb", __FILE__)
p file

Daemons.run_proc(
  'eveService', # name of daemon
#  :dir_mode => :normal
#  :dir => File.join(pwd, 'tmp/pids'), # directory where pid file will be stored
#  :backtrace => true,
#  :monitor => true,
  :log_output => true
) do
  exec "ruby #{file}"
end
