# Eve 7

Eve 6 and below finally achieved it's goal of becoming a comprehensive IRC bot for intermediate users. Users who didn't know code might have had some issues editing some of the configuration. The goal of Eve 7 is to alleviate any of those issues and bring and even more comprehensive bot to the table that can do any, and every thing you need, or want out of an IRC bot. 

Here's what you can look forward to with Eve 7:

  - A first-run wizard to configure masters and plugins before the bot even connects to IRC for it's first time!
  - Plugins will be faster and more secure!
  - Greater customization of the bot directly from IRC!
  - Master levels, for greater control of master privileges!
  - Automatic dependency installation!
  - Associate the bot with a gender!
  - The bot can record a user's gender!
  - **eveMotion** will give the bot a "fuzzy logic" feel and even moodswings!
  - Restart the bot from IRC without having to log into an SSH session!
