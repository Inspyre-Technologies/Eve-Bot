### Where to Get Help
Before asking us for help it is always wise to check out the [Eve-Bot Wiki](https://github.com/Namasteh/Eve-Bot/wiki). There you can get help on each of the individual plugins, and we add common errors people run into if they're reported to us on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Namasteh/Eve-Bot/issues) or on our IRC channel.

One of the things we pride ourselves on with Eve-Bot is offering a simple system for people to use. We don't wish to make running your own version of Eve-Bot complicated at all. Therefore you can find us on IRC at irc.sinsira.net in channel #Eve. Feel free to come and chat, hang out, or even get support.
